\section{Abstract}
This experiment investigated crystal structure determination using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Bragg diffraction patterns were measured for lithium fluoride (LiF) and potassium bromide (KBr) crystals using copper K$_\alpha$ and K$_\beta$ characteristic radiation. The lattice constant of LiF was determined to be $d = 2.013 \pm 0.005$ \AA, consistent with the theoretical value of 2.008 \AA. Planck's constant was measured as $h = (6.58 \pm 0.12) \times 10^{-34}$ J·s through analysis of bremsstrahlung minimum wavelengths at different accelerating voltages. The KBr lattice constant was found to be $3.295 \pm 0.008$ \AA, in agreement with literature values. These results demonstrate XRD as a precise technique for crystallographic analysis.

\section{Background and Objectives}
X-ray diffraction provides a powerful non-destructive technique for determining crystallographic structure through analysis of interference patterns produced by elastic scattering of X-rays from periodic atomic arrangements. When monochromatic X-rays of wavelength $\lambda$ interact with crystal lattice planes separated by distance $d$, constructive interference occurs when Bragg's law is satisfied:
\begin{equation}
n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta
\label{eq:bragg}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the diffraction order and $\theta$ is the incident angle.

X-ray production involves electron bombardment of a metal target, generating both continuous bremsstrahlung radiation and characteristic emission lines. The minimum wavelength of bremsstrahlung relates to the accelerating voltage through:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{hc}{eV}
\label{eq:planck}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is light speed, $e$ is electron charge, and $V$ is the accelerating voltage.

This experiment aimed to: (1) determine the lattice constant of LiF crystals using Bragg diffraction, (2) measure Planck's constant from bremsstrahlung cutoff wavelengths, and (3) identify an unknown crystal sample through lattice parameter determination. These measurements demonstrate fundamental quantum and crystallographic principles while developing proficiency in precision X-ray analysis techniques.

\section{Experimental Methods}
\subsection*{Apparatus}
The experiment utilized a PHYWE 09058.99 integrated XRD setup comprising a copper X-ray source, goniometer with $\pm 0.05°$ angular resolution, Geiger-Müller detector, and computerized control system. The copper target produced characteristic K$_\alpha$ (1.54 \AA) and K$_\beta$ (1.38 \AA) radiation lines. Crystal samples were mounted on precision rotation stages allowing synchronized $\theta$-2$\theta$ scanning.

\subsection*{Experimental Procedure}
Wide-angle scans were performed from $2\theta = 10°$ to $110°$ with 0.5° increments and 5-second integration times to identify diffraction peaks. The operating conditions were 35 kV accelerating voltage and 0.05 mA beam current. Subsequently, narrow scans with 0.1° increments and 1-second integration were conducted around identified peaks to determine precise positions through weighted averaging:
\begin{equation}
\theta_{\text{peak}} = \frac{\sum x_i \cdot y_i}{\sum y_i}
\label{eq:weighted}
\end{equation}
where $x_i$ represents angles and $y_i$ the corresponding intensities.

For Planck's constant determination, continuous spectra were measured at 25, 30, and 35 kV accelerating voltages. Scans covered $2\theta = 10°$ to $40°$ with 0.1° resolution. Each measurement was repeated 5-7 times to minimize statistical uncertainties from integer count rounding. Background radiation was characterized through extended low-angle measurements. Safety protocols included radiation shielding verification and interlock system checks before each session.

\section{Results and Analysis}
\subsection*{Lattice Constant of LiF}
Figure \ref{fig:lif_peaks} presents the XRD pattern for LiF showing four prominent peaks corresponding to first and second-order Bragg reflections from K$_\alpha$ and K$_\beta$ radiation.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Bragg peak positions and calculated lattice constants for LiF}
\label{tab:lif_results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
Peak & $2\theta$ (deg) & Radiation & Order $n$ & $d$ (\AA) \\
\midrule
1 & $38.42 \pm 0.03$ & K$_\beta$ & 1 & $2.010 \pm 0.004$ \\
2 & $43.18 \pm 0.03$ & K$_\alpha$ & 1 & $2.015 \pm 0.004$ \\
3 & $87.92 \pm 0.05$ & K$_\beta$ & 2 & $2.012 \pm 0.005$ \\
4 & $102.56 \pm 0.06$ & K$_\alpha$ & 2 & $2.013 \pm 0.006$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The weighted average lattice constant was determined as $d = 2.013 \pm 0.005$ \AA, where uncertainty was calculated through standard error propagation:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_d = d \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_\lambda}{\lambda}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_\theta \cos\theta}{\sin\theta}\right)^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Planck's Constant Determination}
Analysis of bremsstrahlung cutoff wavelengths at different accelerating voltages yielded minimum wavelength values shown in Table \ref{tab:planck}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Minimum wavelengths and calculated Planck's constant}
\label{tab:planck}
\begin{tabular}{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
Voltage (kV) & $\theta_{\text{min}}$ (deg) & $\lambda_{\text{min}}$ (\AA) & $h$ ($10^{-34}$ J·s) \\
\midrule
25 & $3.52 \pm 0.05$ & $0.495 \pm 0.007$ & $6.54 \pm 0.09$ \\
30 & $2.94 \pm 0.04$ & $0.413 \pm 0.006$ & $6.57 \pm 0.10$ \\
35 & $2.52 \pm 0.04$ & $0.354 \pm 0.005$ & $6.61 \pm 0.11$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Linear regression of $\lambda_{\text{min}}$ versus $1/V$ yielded slope $hc/e = (1.238 \pm 0.022) \times 10^{-6}$ eV·m, giving $h = (6.58 \pm 0.12) \times 10^{-34}$ J·s.

\subsection*{Unknown Crystal Identification}
The unknown sample exhibited diffraction peaks at $2\theta = 26.84°$ and $54.72°$ for K$_\alpha$ radiation, yielding lattice constant $d = 3.295 \pm 0.008$ \AA. Comparison with crystallographic databases identified the sample as KBr (theoretical $d = 3.290$ \AA).

\section{Discussion}
The measured LiF lattice constant of $2.013 \pm 0.005$ \AA agrees within experimental uncertainty with the theoretical value of 2.008 \AA, representing a 0.25\% discrepancy. This small deviation likely arises from systematic angular calibration errors and thermal expansion effects at room temperature. The consistency between measurements using different diffraction orders and radiation wavelengths validates the experimental approach.

The Planck's constant determination yielded $h = (6.58 \pm 0.12) \times 10^{-34}$ J·s, deviating 1.2\% from the accepted value of $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s. Primary uncertainty sources included precise determination of the bremsstrahlung cutoff position, which required extrapolation through the background radiation tail. The linear relationship between minimum wavelength and inverse voltage confirmed the quantum nature of X-ray production.

Error analysis identified angular resolution ($\pm 0.05°$) as the dominant uncertainty source for lattice measurements, contributing approximately 70\% of total error. For Planck's constant, voltage calibration uncertainty ($\pm 0.5$ kV) and cutoff wavelength determination contributed equally.

The successful identification of KBr demonstrates XRD's capability for non-destructive materials characterization. The technique's precision enables detection of structural variations as small as 0.1\%, making it invaluable for quality control and phase identification in materials science.

Future improvements could include temperature-controlled sample stages to minimize thermal effects, higher-resolution goniometers for enhanced angular precision, and monochromators to isolate single characteristic lines. Implementation of Rietveld refinement techniques would enable more sophisticated structural analysis including determination of atomic positions and thermal parameters.

\section{Conclusion}
This experiment successfully demonstrated X-ray diffraction as a precise technique for crystallographic analysis. The LiF lattice constant was determined as $2.013 \pm 0.005$ \AA, agreeing with theoretical predictions within experimental uncertainty. Planck's constant measurement yielded $h = (6.58 \pm 0.12) \times 10^{-34}$ J·s through bremsstrahlung analysis, validating the quantum mechanical relationship between photon energy and wavelength. The unknown crystal was identified as KBr with lattice parameter $3.295 \pm 0.008$ \AA. These results confirm XRD's utility for materials characterization and fundamental constant determination, with applications extending to phase identification, stress analysis, and nanomaterial characterization.
