## Overview

Complete experimental analysis of Hall Effect measurements in p-type and n-type Germanium semiconductors. The project involved:

- **Carrier Type Identification**: Determined carrier types via Hall voltage polarity analysis
- **Mobility Measurements**: Cross-validated mobility through Hall effect and magnetoresistance methods
- **Temperature Dependence**: Observed intrinsic transition at 106°C
- **Data Analysis**: Publication-quality plots with comprehensive error analysis

## Key Results

- Successfully identified carrier types (n-type and p-type) via Hall voltage polarity
- Cross-validated mobility measurements using two independent methods
- Observed intrinsic transition temperature in p-type Germanium
- Comprehensive error propagation and uncertainty analysis

## Technical Details

- **Analysis Tools**: Python (numpy, matplotlib, scipy)
- **Data Processing**: Linear regression, quadratic fitting
- **Visualization**: Publication-quality plots (300 dpi, serif fonts)
- **Report**: Typst document with comprehensive analysis
