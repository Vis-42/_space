*Why I want to participate in GIT-26:*

#v(0.5em)

I am applying for the Germany Physics Immersion Programme because it offers a rare chance to experience how leading research in physics is done. As a physics undergraduate at NUS, I have spent years working with theory, equations, and simulations, but I want to see how those ideas take shape in real experiments and institutions that have defined modern science.

The visits to the University of Munich, the Max Planck Institutes, and the Göttingen research facilities connect directly with my academic interests. I am especially interested in how these labs balance creativity with technical discipline, and how collaboration across teams allows breakthroughs that are impossible in isolation. Observing research on nanowires, x-ray optics, and high-energy physics would help me understand how experimental design and precision make theoretical concepts testable. This exposure would bridge what I have learned in class with how research is actually carried out at the frontiers of physics.

Germany’s research culture stands out for its clarity, persistence, and deep respect for scientific curiosity. Experiencing this approach in person, whether at the Garching Research Reactor or the Wendelstein Observatory, would show me what it means to build and sustain a rigorous scientific environment. I want to see how scientists there think, collaborate, and question their own assumptions, because those habits define the kind of physicist I aspire to become.

The cultural component of the programme gives the experience more depth than a typical academic trip. Visiting the Deutsches Museum or the “Fröhliche Wissenschaft” exhibition in Göttingen is not just about sightseeing but about understanding how science lives within a culture. These places show that physics can inspire as much wonder as art or music. I want to learn how that connection between scientific discovery and public imagination is built, and how it keeps research human and relevant.

I hope to return from this immersion with a clearer sense of how research questions evolve into experiments, how ideas move between theory and practice, and how science connects across borders. More than anything, I want to bring back the mindset that defines the best physicists: curiosity, precision, and a belief that learning is a lifelong process.
